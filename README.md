## Making a model translatable
 According to spaite pakcage:-
- to make default local open config/translatable and edit 'fallback_locale' => null, to your prefferd local like: 'fallback_locale' => ar, if you prefer Arabic.
- NOTE: This prefferd local for translated models not for App local, this mean if you insert product with many languages the primary language will be ar.

- All Toturials for Translation package [here](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-translatable) , you do't need to install it , it is preinstalled, Just see Toturials.
